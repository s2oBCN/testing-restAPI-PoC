The intention of this article is to provide a simple sample of testing a REST API Web Service. The code of this sample can be found at https://github.com/s2oBCN/testing-restAPI-PoC

In the sample we will use this technological stack:

* Gradle [https://gradle.org/]: it is a tool to automate the build process. There are a lot of comparatives between Maven and Gradle, in our case we choose Gradle because of its incremental compilation, smart testing (if a project has nothing changed then the tests will not be re-executed) and for its Groovy scripting, within you can do some cool things like:
* Spring boot 1.4  [http://codecentric.github.io/spring-boot-admin]: maybe the easiest way to bootstrapping a JEE application.
* Spock 1.0 [http://spockframework.org/]: it is a Groovy test framework that also can be used to test java applications. It is cool because of its expressive DSL, but itâ€™s needed to use it to see all its power.
* Cucumber 1.2 [https://cucumber.io/]: because we will use BDD with Java, and we want our Bussines Analyst to review the Scenarios.
* Serenity 1.1 [http://www.thucydides.info/]: because of its IOC ready to use and its reports.
* Rest Assured 3.0 [http://rest-assured.io/]: because of its fluent way of testing a web service.
* Gatling 2.2 [http://gatling.io/]: incredibly easy to modify the configuration in order to test differents parameters of performance.
